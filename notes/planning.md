# StudyBuddy

The idea:

- a web app that allows students to study better, longer with more focus and effeciency
- a tool that allows them to manage study sessions, create and manage their study related tasks and todos, take notes, set goals and track/see progress.

The major sections of the app would be:

- Study
  - Tasks
  - Sessions
  - Notes
  - Group session
- Goals
- Learn
  - Library
  - AI Bot
- Hub

All these major featuers like tasks, session, notes, goals will leverage a same base "creator" component that allows users to add meta data about that particular thing and link it to other thing. (A tasks created using Task craetor can be synced with a session. A session created using Session Creator can have multiple notes linked to it).

## 1 - Study

This is the most important feature/section where a student will spend most of the time as all the sub features that are related to "studying effectively" will be here included here only.

For an effective studying, a student:

- needs a proper planning and schedule (tasks)
- needs a space to focus on single session and document everything related to the session. (session, notes)

### 1.1 - Tasks

- This will be a mini task manager inside the app that will allow students to create and manage their tasks and todos.

- Subfeatures in this Tasks section:

  - Task creator template (dialog)
  - Calender
    - native
    - as well as syncing functionality with Google calender
  - Sync/schedule session with the feature to reschedule
  - "Today", "Tomorrow" and "This week"
    - not sure on the style. valid options:
      - kanban board
      - bento box
      - block layout
      - something else
  - What to do with unfinished tasks for the day?

- Major UI points:

  - A big button to create a task
  - Each task will be created using a Task creater, that would act a template to add information related to task such as name, date, tags, scheduled session, notification timer
  - search feature to search tasks
  - all tasks
    - filter by date, tags, upcoming session, unfinished
    - search by keyword

### 1.2 - Sessions

- Though process, pain-point:

  - How do I make sure that I study effectively when I sit down to?

    - Clear planning
    - Scheduled sessions

      - "Tasks" feature will solve the above two

    - Lesser distraction/more focus

      - "Study music" feature
      - simple feature to "note down distractions" that would help to build awareness and improve next time.
      - focus mode: to block other distractive websites/apps

    - Accountability: Group study, "public goals" feature

    - Reward

      - Badges for consistency, long study sessions, hitting daily goals
      - Hub
        - small social media or leader board type of thing where students can be ranked on how much they are studying. (is this even a good metric to rank. instant problem: what if somebody just open the timer and doesn't study. Any better metric?)

    - Session templates

  - One of the biggest struggles for students is to remember what they studied in a session. They don't need to remember every detail, but a high-level understanding and memory of their new learning is crucial. Providing a stucture/method that forces them to deliberately condense all their learnings into smaller, simpler high-level chunks/notes can be really powerful. Each session will have a dedicated small section to jot down high-level learnings and would also have to option to connect to "Notes", if they want to refer their detailed notes later.

- Subfeatures:

  - Session creator

    - Scheduled
    - Instant/new
      - This will allow student to fill session-related meta data when they would save it.

  - Clock

    - Pomodoro clock
      - with option to configure focus-break durations
    - Regular clock
      - with manual documentation for breaks

  - Play study-music

  - High level learning

    - feature to add/link notes

  - Session Review Prompts

    - Documenting distractions
    - what went well

  - Previous/completed sessions of the day
  - Upcoming session

  - All sessions
    - search
    - filter: by date, tags,

### 1.3 - Notes

- This will be a full fledge note-taking mini-app for students to take effective notes
- The note-taking style will be similar to Notion but not so heavly nested or linked.
- Combine "Notion-style editor and note-taking" with stucture and organization of "Goodnotes"

- Subfeatures:

  - Note Integration: Ensure deep integration with the Sessions feature so that notes can be seamlessly linked and accessed.
  - Tagging System: Implement a robust tagging system for notes to easily categorize and retrieve them.
  - Multimedia Support: Allow embedding of images, videos, and audio recordings within notes.
  - Collaboration: Enable real-time collaboration on notes for group study sessions.

## 2 - Goals

- This feature will allow a student to set study related goals and track progress and see progress reports.

- How?

- Simple goal-setting framework:

  - How much you want to study in a day?
  - How much per week?
  - Which field/tag/category/subject you want to focus more or dedicate particular time to? Is there a subject or a project that needs work and you want to dedicate particular hours and also have a deadline?

    - All tasks and sessions completed can be linked here for this goal. This would give proper feedback on the amount of work a student has done for that particular project/goal.

  - Reports:

    - Progress charts/bars for total studying hour commitment
    - A reflection on their distractions
    - Sharable to social media

- Subfeatures:

  - Adaptive Goals: Allow goals to adjust based on progress. For example, if a student consistently exceeds their study time goal, the app could suggest a new target.
  - Goal Milestones: Break down larger goals into smaller, actionable milestones.
  - Progress Alerts: Provide alerts and notifications for goal progress and upcoming deadlines.
  - Peer Goals: Allow students to see goals set by their peers (anonymously if needed) for motivation and ideas.

## 3 - Learn

- Idea 1:

  - A place to teach student about meta-learning and effective studying techniques:
    - meta-learning category wise:
      - blogs, videos, research papers......all in one for each category

Idea 2: - A mini youtube that uses youtube api to show only meta-learning and learning-related content only

## 4 - Hub

- This will be small social media/community of all students who are currently using StudyBuddy.

Subfeatures:

- students can share their "goals" publically and ask for "accountability buddies" who will provide a feedback "star" if they complete their goals or "x" if they fail to do so.
- leaderboards
- basic post creation, comments, like, save feature

## Additional Features to Consider:

- Study History Analytics: Offer detailed analytics on study patterns, focus levels, and productivity trends over time.
- Habit Tracking: Integrate a habit tracker for non-study habits that impact study effectiveness, such as sleep, exercise, and nutrition.
- Virtual Rewards: Implement a virtual currency or point system that can be redeemed for digital rewards or discounts on educational resources.
- Mindfulness and Well-being: Incorporate features for mindfulness exercises, guided meditation, or quick physical exercises to keep students' minds and bodies healthy.
- Offline Mode: Ensure that key functionalities are available offline, so students can study without an internet connection.
- API Integrations: Integrate with popular learning management systems (LMS) and educational platforms for seamless data flow.

- More Complex Features:

  - Intergrate AI: Create an AI assistant that can help elaborate notes, provide answers to questions, help come up with relevant tags

  - Integrate a whiteboard: In addition to diital notes, students can also use whiteboar more free-style notes.

    - Two styles: Handwritten and/or MindMaps

  - A bot to post on Twitter/LinkedIn
